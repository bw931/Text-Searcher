# Text-Searcher
JavaScript Tool for searching text for pieces of text

This works by checking the text for the first letter of the keyword, then pushing (adding) the number of characters equal to your keyword's length to an array. By inspecting the array, you are now able to see whether the keyword was mentioned.
